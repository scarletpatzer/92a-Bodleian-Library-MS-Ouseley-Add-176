    "description":"According to Mario Casari, in his scholarly essay \"The Conceits of Poetry’: Firdausi’s Shahnama and the discovery of Persian in early modern Europe,\" he states that \"the Shahnama is based on a long tradition of Persian stories - transmitted both orally and textually\" (Casari, 2013, 119). He also declares that \"the Shahnama is one of the most voluminous epics of world literature\" (Casari, 119). This image of Rustam mortally wounding Suhrab in the Firdausi Shahnama displays two men fighting. The man on top is Rustam, the father. The man on the bottom, Suhrab, is his son. The picture indicates the two men fighting, as Rustam is depicted on top of Suhrab, choking him. These two men are father and son but do not know this at the time of their battle, and Rustam is fighting the enemy of Iran in this battle. The picture shows Rustam on top, evidently overpowering Suhrab in this fight. However, before this, Suhrab had almost killed Rustam by cutting his head off, but the customs in wrestling demand that one cannot cut another one's head off. Since these customs exist, Rustam escaped his death. They had scheduled another battle to occur the next day. After this battle transpired, Rustam felt defeated. Before the battle, he prayed to God to take his inhumane strength away to be like other men. However, after the challenge and feeling overpowered, he prayed to God again for his strength to come back to him, and God granted his strength back. The next day, they again encounter one another. The story ends with Rustam wounding Suhrab so significantly that Suhrab succumbs to his injuries and passes away without Rustam knowing he has just committed an act of filicide."},

    "description":"\"The preliminary drawings for this work were made early in the spring of 1874. After a careful consideration of the subject, it was determined to locate the point of view so that the city would be seen from the southeast, believing that to be the most advantageous in all respects. Accordingly, the point of site was established on the Illinois side of the river, looking to the northwest, and at sufficient altitude to overlook the roofs of ordinary houses into the streets. A careful perspective, which required a surface of three hundred square feet, was then erected from a correct survey of the city, extending northward from Arsenal Island...\""},

Dry and his assistants, and the faithfulness and accuracy with which this work has been done an examination of the pages will attest. Absolute truth and accuracy in the representation of the territory has been the standard and in no cases have additions or alterations been made unless the same were actually in course of construction. In a few cases, important public and private edifices that are not yet finished are shown completed, and as they will appear when done. All the buildings within the limits of the survey in July, 1875, are shown; and a very large number of those executed or commenced since that date have been also introduced, the pages having been constantly corrected up to the last possible moment before publication.\""},
