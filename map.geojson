    "description":"According to Mario Casari, in his scholarly essay \"The Conceits of Poetry: Firdausi’s Shahnama and the discovery of Persian in early modern Europe,\" he states that \"the Shahnama is based on a long tradition of Persian stories - transmitted both orally and textually\" (Casari, 2013, 119). He also declares that \"The Shahnama is one of the most voluminous epics of world literature\" (Casari, 119). This image of Rustam mortally wounding Suhrab in the Firdausi Shahnama displays two men fighting. The man on top is Rustam, the father. The man on the bottom, Suhrab, is his son. The picture indicates the two men fighting, as Rustam is depicted on top of Suhrab, choking him. These two men are father and son but do not know this at the time of their battle, and Rustam is fighting the enemy of Iran in this battle. The picture shows Rustam, evidently overpowering Suhrab in this fight. However, before this, Suhrab had almost killed Rustam by cutting his head off, but the customs in wrestling demand that one cannot cut another one's head off. Since these customs exist, Rustam escaped his death. They had scheduled another battle to occur the next day. After this battle transpired, Rustam felt defeated. Before the battle, he prayed to God to take his inhumane strength away to be like other men. However, after the challenge and feeling overpowered, he prayed to God again for his strength to come back to him, and God granted his wish. The next day, they again encounter one another. The story ends with Rustam wounding Suhrab so significantly that Suhrab succumbs to his injuries and passes away. During Suhrab passing away, Rustam discover’s that Suhrab was his son when he finds a clasp on his body that he gave to a woman, meant for the child if one were to be born, many years prior."},

    "description":"Rustam is the son of Zal and the father of Suhrab. In his article, \"From Epic to Romance, via Filicide? Rustam's Character Formation,\" Fraser Clark states that \"Sam [wrote] a letter to Zal one week after Rustam's birth, .. which he describes his joy that he has a grandson\" (Clark, 57). Immediately after being born, Rustam is loved by his grandfather, Sam, who is trying to show the affection he has for Rustam, trying to make up for not giving Zal the same affection in his childhood. Clark declares, \"Sam believes that Rustam will secure the family's structure\" (Clark, 58). Rustam will put the pieces back together for this family that has been missing since Sam abandoned his son, Zal when he was first born. For Zal, there is a sense of insecurity when it comes to family because of the actions of his father. However, this sense of insecurity changes when Rustam is born because Zal wants to be a good father, unlike his own. Clark exclaims that \"Rustam will grow up to be indulged, loved, and protected as a highly valued member of the family\" (Clark, 58). Rustam growing up in such a loving and nurturing way is essential for the family's structure because Zal was not cared for in this way in his youth by his father, and it is important to change and break the cycle. However, despite all the love shown to Rustam, Clark states that \"a dynamic of unrequited love develops, as whilst being valued highly by one and all, Rustam fails to express any warmth of emotion in return\" Clark, (58). Rustam does not show emotions and, instead, turns cold. He turns into a drunk, selfish, rude man. However, despite his personality, \"with violence done for authority .. Rustam will be able to climb the heroic hierarchy through actions done\" Clark, (57). Even though Rustam turns into an awful, selfish man, he still works his way up the heroic hierarchy."},

    "description":"Rustam is the son of Zal and is the father of Suhrab. During the Shahnama, Rustam was a very controversial character. Rustam is selfish, rude, only cares about himself and hurts people just to feel what he is missing in his life. Clark states that \"Rustam is famed for being one of the most fleshed-out characters [in] the Shahnama\" (Clark, 2010, 53). He also states that the author of the Shahnama, Firdausi, bestowed lots of realism upon his characters (Clark, 2010, 53). The author of the Shahnama tried to make his characters realistic, and make them have features normal people do. However, Rustam is portrayed having anger issues, and this inhumane strength, which he uses inappropriately to hurt people. Clark declares in his article that no character in the Shahnama has a greater \"depth of characterisation .. more evident than in the person of Rostam\" (Clark, 53). No other character in the Shahnama is as intense as Rustam’s character. Rustam is a powerful character, physically, ever since he was granted an intense strength by God. Clark states, \"Rustam demonstrates his physical strength for the first time by killing Zal's white elephant\" (Clark, 56). Rustam's character is very strong, and he uses this to his advantage by hurting people and things. Clark states that \"Rustam will fight with vigor for his patrons, but without heartfelt motivation\" (Clark, 56-57), demonstrating that Rustam will fight, not for any reason necessarily, instead, just to hurt someone. There is a tale in the Shahnama that states that before his battle with Suhrab, \"Rustam had .. strength bestowed by him\" (Firdausi, 1420-40, Vol 2, 171). He had so much strength that it scared him. Therefore, he prayed to God to take his strength away. However, after losing the first battle with Suhrab, he prayed to God to grant his strength back so that he could win. God granted his strength back, and Rustam won the battle."},

    "description":"The battle occurs between Rustam, a military general, and his son, Suhrab, an enemy from Iran. Before this battle occurred, another one occurred, where Suhrab, the son, was going to kill Rustam by cutting his head off. The Shahnama states that Suhrab “drew a bright steel dagger to cut off Rustam’s head” (Firdausi, 1420-40, Vol 2, 170). Rustam almost experienced death; however, with the customs and rules of wrestling, one is not allowed to behead another. The two men reschedule another battle for the next day. After this battle has taken place, Rustam feels disappointed. He feels he could have done better, so he prays to God to grant his former strength back to beat Suhrab. The Shahnama states “he drank and bathed, .. [and] prayed to God for Strength and Victory” (Firdausi, 1420-44, Vol 2, 171). God grants it back, and the next day the two men meet to battle. Depicted in this image, Rustam is on top of Suhrab, tacking and choking him. Rustam's leg is draped over Suhrab, and he is sitting on him, making it so that Suhrab can not escape. Suhrab's face is red, and his headgear is placed far from him, along with his sword, insinuating that Suhrab had a hard fall to the ground. This image is very depressing, with dark colours providing a sense of weariness and a bizarre feeling toward the viewers. Rustam is shown holding up his sword above his head, wounding Suhrab so intensely, and ends Suhrab's life."},

    "description":"This image depicts Rustam on top of Suhrab during their second battle. Viewers can see Suhrab’s helmet and headgear far from his body, perhaps insinuating that Rustam pushed Suhrab down and he fell hard to the ground. On Rustam’s helmet, viewers can see a Div. The Div’s are essential in the Shahnama; some of them are known as shapeshifters that can turn into lions, and are overall, dangerous characters. They are very mischievous and evil figures with supernatural powers. A div pertaining specifically to Rustam is the White Div, a shapeshifting, evil Div. During the course of Rustam’s mission, the White Div shapeshifts into a lion, to fight Rustam’s horse, Raskh. He does this so he can mess up Rustam’s mission, which is saving the Persian emperor and the army who had been imprisoned and blinded by an army of Divs, led by the White Div. The Div on Rustam’s helmet is very significant for this image and story. Rustam is a very selfish, ungrateful man who has always been aggressive and a fighter, and has had no emotions whilst growing up. Perhaps a Div shapeshifted and tricked Rustam, making him more evil and making it so that Rustam wanted to brutally kill someone. Possibly, Suhrab was an easy target with Rustam having his super strength back? A div being on Rustam’s helmet is very important in this image."},
